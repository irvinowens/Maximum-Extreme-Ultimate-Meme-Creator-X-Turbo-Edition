Maximum-Extreme-Ultimate-Meme-Creator-X-Turbo-Edition
=====================================================

A Meme Creator for Android.

The meme creator will create animated gifs from local video sources, it will also allow you to create meme images pretty easily.

# Basic Instructions

It should just build with eclipse.  It uses the JavaCV library which is an NDK library, so you'll need the NDK installed and Api tools 21.

## Basic Usage Instructions

The use is pretty simple, when making a meme image, you can long press on the image in the editor to adjust the font size.  When editing a frame the same applies, however when you apply it will apply to all of the subsequent frames.

This project still has bugs around settings and I haven't had time yet to properly write unit tests and fully document the code.

When choosing frames for your video meme, you will probably want to select multiple frames for deletion and just leave the rest of the frames there.  The best way to accomplish this is to long press on a frame, choose select all from the menu and then tap to deselect the frames you want to keep.  When you are done, just select delete from the menu.

Many of the features are hidden behind the menu button, sorry, it was originally designed for 2.3.

I hope something in here is of use!
